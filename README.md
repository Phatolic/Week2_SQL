## B. Runner and Customer Experience  
- How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)  
- What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
- Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
- What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
- What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
- What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
- What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
